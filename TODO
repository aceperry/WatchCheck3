Functional
- App in background and restart during measuring does not work
- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- "Help" goes to the localized webpages
- create two new webpages (international and german)

Design
- "am Arm" shows no temperature and thus could be centered over both columns
- transitions

Enhancements
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??
- Back link from "add log" shall go to "measure watch" not to result list (non-trivial)
- On the result table: Display an info icon, if comment was filled.
- import/export data from and to Google Drive
- landscape?
