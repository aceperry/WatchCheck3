- Adding new watch totally confuses the app and the navigation drawer
  It should automatically select that new watch as current watch!!
- It should automatically select the last tab (last period)
- First log on a screen display data twice or too high. Looks, like the fragment and pager are broken
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??

- Vibrate on logging
- (+)-Button sometimes disappears and should be above the average
- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- import data (old and new format, with file chooser) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7856959/android-file-chooser
- import/export data from and to Google Drive
- FilePickerLibrary: https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/FilePickerLibrary
- Material design: https://github.com/navasmdc/MaterialDesignLibrary
- white background for dialogs
- more polishing
- create two new webpages (international and german)
- after deleting a watch, display different logs and update menu!
- For whatever reason, GPS time is 1sec ahead NTP time
- App terminates after a few minutes
- landscape?

- localization
