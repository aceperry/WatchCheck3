- Adding new watch totally confuses the app and the navigation drawer
  It should automatically select that new watch as current watch!!
- Deviation on last log and on measure screen differ!!! Maybe just a rounding issue!
- After a log, the deviation from the last but one item is taken! This is weird!!!
- First log on a screen display data twice or too high. Looks, like the fragment and pager are broken
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??
- On the result table: Display an info icon, if comment was filled.
- On the SelectWatch menu: Display an info icon, if comment was filled.
- SelectWatch Drawer could use as background image my watch Schublade
- (+)-Button sometimes disappears and should be above the average
- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- importer crashes and does not update results below
- "Help" goes to the localized webpages
- import/export data from and to Google Drive
- Material design: https://github.com/navasmdc/MaterialDesignLibrary
- white background for three dot dialog (overflow menu)
- more polishing
- create two new webpages (international and german)
- after deleting a watch, display different logs and update menu!
- For whatever reason, GPS time is 1sec ahead NTP time
- App terminates after a few minutes
- landscape?

- localization

- check if imported data now fixes the average!
