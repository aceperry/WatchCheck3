Functional
- Back link from "add log" shall go to "measure watch" not to result list
- Deviation on last log and on measure screen differ!!! Maybe just a rounding issue!
- After a log, the deviation from the last but one item is taken! This is weird!!!
- First log on a screen display data twice or too high. Looks, like the fragment and pager are broken
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??
- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- importer crashes and does not update results below
- "Help" goes to the localized webpages
- create two new webpages (international and german)
- after deleting a watch, display different logs and update menu!
- If last watch was deleted, check, whether a "clean" first screen can be seen!
- For whatever reason, GPS time is 1sec ahead NTP time
- ntp time flaps on Lollipop
- Hamburger-Menu starts below ActionBar. Why??
- localization to german
- check if imported data now fixes the average!

Design
- Cards disappear on Lollipop
- Context menu on result has got no material design yet! Very difficult!!
  Use no context menu, but jump to "Add log" dialog, just like on
  long click on watch menu
- transitions

Enhancements
- On the result table: Display an info icon, if comment was filled.
- splash screen == background if no logs are to be displayed
- import/export data from and to Google Drive
- landscape?
