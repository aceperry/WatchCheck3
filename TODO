Functional
- Importer does not update results and navigation

- Deviation on last log and on measure screen differ!!! Maybe just a rounding issue!
- After a log, the deviation from the last but one item is taken! This is weird!!!
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??
- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- importer crashes and does not update results below
- "Help" goes to the localized webpages
- create two new webpages (international and german)
- For whatever reason, GPS time is 1sec ahead NTP time
- ntp time flaps on Lollipop
- localization to german

Design
- transitions

Enhancements
- Back link from "add log" shall go to "measure watch" not to result list (non-trivial)
- On the result table: Display an info icon, if comment was filled.
- import/export data from and to Google Drive
- landscape?
