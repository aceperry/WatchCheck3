Functional
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??
- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- "Help" goes to the localized webpages
- create two new webpages (international and german)
- For whatever reason, GPS time is 1sec ahead NTP time
- ntp time flaps on Lollipop

Design
- "Time of your watch", "Seconds to zero" deutlicher!!
- transitions

Enhancements
- Back link from "add log" shall go to "measure watch" not to result list (non-trivial)
- On the result table: Display an info icon, if comment was filled.
- import/export data from and to Google Drive
- landscape?
