- Adding new watch totally confuses the app and the navigation drawer
  It should automatically select that new watch as current watch!!
- First log on a screen display data twice or too high. Looks, like the fragment and pager are broken
- Default temperature is -273. Is this really useful??

- "about" screen, point to localized URLs
- import data (old and new format)
- export data (new format only)
- delete data from lists (long press)
- display averages on lists (keep an eye on former error!)
- white background for dialogs
- more polishing
- create two new webpages (international and german)
- after deleting a watch, display different logs and update menu!
